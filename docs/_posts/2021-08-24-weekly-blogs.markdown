Blog's are due Every Friday by 11:59pm for both Fall and Spring semester. Canvas assignments will open each week on Wednesday @ 12:00am and close on Friday's at 11:59pm. Be sure to post a link to your weekly blog post not to your main For example, I have another blog post and the url I would submit on canvas would be:
